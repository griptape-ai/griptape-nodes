# Getting started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape-nodes.git
   ```

1. Install `uv`: https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/.

1. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd griptape-nodes
   ```

1. Install the project's dependencies:

   ```shell
   make install
   ```

1. Install the stdlib of scripts/nodes:

   ```shell
   ./install.sh
   ```

   If you have Griptape Nodes API key, pass it as an argument to the install script:

   ```shell
   ./install.sh <API_KEY>
   ```

1. Configure the Engine to use the nodes library in this repo.

   By default, the Engine looks for the nodes library set up by the `./install.sh` script:
   https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape-nodes/blob/24d1fdab898e1617793eeb55b7a5a87c161502ef/install.sh?plain=1#L63-L64
   https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape-nodes/blob/24d1fdab898e1617793eeb55b7a5a87c161502ef/src/griptape_nodes/retained_mode/managers/settings.py?plain=1#L52-L54

   When developing locally, we want to configure the Engine to use the nodes library in this repo:

   1. Create a file `griptape_nodes_config.json` in the root of your project.
   1. Add the following content to the file:
      ```json
      {
        "app_events": {
          "on_app_initialization_complete": {
            "libraries_to_register": [
              "nodes/griptape_nodes_library.json"
            ],
          }
        }
      }
      ```

1. Run the engine ðŸš—:

   ```shell
   make run
   ```

   To start the engine using SSE (Server Sent Events) to the remote Griptape Nodes API:
   `GT_CLOUD_API_KEY=<your_key> make run`

1. Navigate to the URL provided in the terminal.

# Make Commands

Review [Makefile](https://github.com/griptape-ai/griptape-nodes/blob/main/Makefile) for all commands.

Check the project (type-check, format, lint):

```shell
make check
```

Format the project:

```shell
make format
```

Automatically fix issues (format, lint):

```shell

```

Serve the documentation:

```shell
make docs/serve
```

# Engine Commands

Install the engine using the following command:

```bash
uv tool install .
```

You can now run the `griptape-nodes` command (`gtn` shorthand).

Start the engine:

```
