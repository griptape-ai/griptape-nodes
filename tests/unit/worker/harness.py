"""In-process harness for exercising orchestrator<->worker event routing.

Motivation
----------
`WorkerManager.route_to_worker` and `EventManager.ahandle_request` connect via
a WebSocket pub/sub transport in production. That transport is overkill for
unit tests of the routing contract itself: two EventManagers (one "orchestrator"
side and one "worker" side) can be connected in-memory and exercise the same
code paths up to the transport boundary. Fake that transport with an asyncio
queue + a pending-futures map and the tests observe exactly what the wire
contract is supposed to do.

What this harness covers
------------------------
- Orchestrator initiates an `ExecuteNodeRequest` by calling the harness's
  `route_to_worker`, which simulates the WebSocket round-trip and resolves
  with the worker's real `EventManager.ahandle_request` result.
- Worker-side forwarding of `ForwardFromWorkerMixin` requests back to the
  orchestrator via `worker_node_execution_scope` is wired by overriding
  `EventManager._forward_to_orchestrator` on the worker-side instance so the
  forward hits the orchestrator-side `EventManager.ahandle_request`.

Intentional limits
------------------
No WebSocket, no subprocess, no MQTT payload shape details. Serialization
faithfulness (converters/validators/traits across the JSON boundary -- see
issue #4472/A and #4475/D) belongs in a separate harness that exercises the
on-the-wire dict shape. Here we go straight Python-object to Python-object,
which is enough for routing/concurrency/forwarding coverage.
