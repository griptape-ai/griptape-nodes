"""Strict-mode rule registry.

Central catalog of every strict-mode rule: its stable ``rule_id``,
default severity, whether it is a correctness-class violation (failed
even on the orchestrator) or an ergonomics-class warning (worker-only
escalation), a human description, and a ``str.format``-ready
remediation template.

Detectors import ``RULES`` to look up their rule and call
``report_violation(rule_id=..., message=RULES[rid].render(...))`` at
their own call site. No enforcement logic lives here -- this module
is a static catalog.

    the worker because the worker's stateless model makes them
