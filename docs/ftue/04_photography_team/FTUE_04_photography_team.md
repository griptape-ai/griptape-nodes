**Tutorial Title: Creating a Coordinated Image Generation System with Griptape Nodes**

**Introduction:**
In this tutorial, you will learn how to coordinate multiple agents using Griptape Nodes to generate a spectacular image prompt. We will introduce the concepts of rule sets and tools, and demonstrate how to convert agents into tools for enhanced functionality.

**Prerequisites:**
- Basic understanding of Griptape Nodes
- Familiarity with agent-based systems
- Previous experience with image generation tasks

**Steps:**

1. **Understanding Rule Sets:**
   - Begin by examining the cinematographer agent, which is initially blank.
   - Introduce a rule set to the agent. A rule set describes how the agent should perform its tasks, focusing on cinematography.
   - Example rule set: Identify the main subject, ensure well-framed images, and evoke a deep connection if no environment is specified.

2. **Implementing Rule Set Lists:**
   - Convert the rule set into a rule set list for the cinematographer agent.
   - You can add an index and drag the rule set directly, but using a list is the preferred pattern.

3. **Introducing Tools:**
   - Define tools as resources an agent can use, such as a calculator, date-time, or web scraper.
   - Learn to convert an agent into a tool, creating a cinematographer tool.
   - Integrate the tool output into a tool list and assign it to the agent.

4. **Creating Specialized Agents:**
   - Develop a color theorist agent with a rule set for color decision-making.
   - Convert this agent into a tool with a descriptive prompt for upstream agents.
   - Design a detail enthusiast agent to focus on intricate details.
   - Establish an image generation specialist to frame prompts for image generation.

5. **Coordinating Agents and Tools:**
   - Assign all tools to a central agent.
   - Allow the cinematographer, color theorist, and detail enthusiast to contribute their expertise.
   - Use a prompt expert to consolidate all inputs into a cohesive image generation prompt.

6. **Executing the Process:**
   - Define the execution order of agents and tools by connecting the execution chain.
   - Ensure the output of the agent feeds into the generate image node.

**Expected Outcome:**
By following this tutorial, you will create a coordinated system of agents and tools that generates a well-structured image prompt, specifically about a teddy bear, using Griptape Nodes.

**Troubleshooting:**
- Ensure all rule sets and tools are correctly assigned to their respective agents.
- Verify the execution chain is properly connected to maintain the desired order of operations.
- Check that the output is correctly feeding into the generate image node.

**Additional Resources:**
- Explore Griptape Nodes documentation for advanced configurations.
- Experiment with different rule sets and tools to enhance your image generation system.
