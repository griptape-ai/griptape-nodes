# OpenAiImageDriverNode

## What is it?
The OpenAiImageDriverNode is a building block that sets up a connection to OpenAI's image generation service (DALL-E). Think of it as configuring a digital artist that can create images based on text descriptions.

## When would I use it?
Use this node when you want to:
- Generate images using OpenAI's DALL-E models
- Create visual content from text descriptions
- Connect image generation capabilities to your workflow

## How to use it

### Basic Setup
1. Add the OpenAiImageDriverNode to your workspace
2. Connect it to your flow
3. Connect its output to nodes that need to generate images (like CreateImageNode)

### Optional Configuration
This node inherits all settings from the BaseImageDriverNode, which may include:
- Model selection
- Image size settings
- Other image generation parameters

### Outputs
- **driver**: The configured OpenAI image driver that other nodes can use

## Example
Imagine you want to create images using OpenAI's DALL-E:

1. Add an OpenAiImageDriverNode to your workflow
2. Configure any available settings
3. Connect the "driver" output to a CreateImageNode's "driver" input
4. Now that node will generate images using OpenAI's DALL-E

## Important Notes
- You need a valid OpenAI API key set up in your environment as `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- This node is a simple wrapper around OpenAI's image generation capabilities
- The specific DALL-E model used will depend on what's configured in the underlying driver

## Common Issues
- **Missing API Key**: Make sure your OpenAI API key is properly set up
- **Connection Errors**: Check your internet connection and API key validity
- **Generation Limits**: Be aware of OpenAI's rate limits and usage quotas
