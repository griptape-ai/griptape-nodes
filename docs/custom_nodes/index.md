# üß© Custom Nodes Authoring Guide

The **Custom Nodes** section explains how to build and maintain your own nodes for Griptape.\
These nodes let you wrap common tools, scripts, and logic into reusable building blocks that can be shared across projects.

## Why build custom nodes

- Automate repetitive tasks
- Integrate existing tools into node graphs
- Create project-specific workflows without modifying the core framework

This guide covers everything from writing a basic node to publishing a polished, well-tested library.

______________________________________________________________________

## Who this is for

- Tech artists who need to build practical tools
- Pipeline TDs creating reusable node libraries
- Python developers reviewing or contributing to node code

Basic Python knowledge is assumed. Familiarity with Griptape helps but isn‚Äôt required to start.

## What you‚Äôll learn

- How nodes work and where they fit in
- How to build and test a node
- How to use capabilities, ports, and artifacts
- How to follow best practices for naming, structure, and versioning
- How to publish and share your node libraries

## Recommended Flow

If you‚Äôre new to authoring nodes, we suggest starting with the **101 Foundations** track and working your way up.\
Each level builds on the previous one.

[101 ‚Äì Foundations](101_foundations/index.md)\
Get set up, understand the Sandbox, and create your first custom node.

[102 ‚Äì Useful Nodes](102_useful_nodes/index.md)\
Add parameters, handle inputs and outputs, and build your first practical node.

[201 ‚Äì Professional Nodes](201_professional_nodes/index.md)\
Learn testing, control flow, error handling, and when to use libraries.

[202 ‚Äì Advanced Nodes](202_advanced_nodes/index.md)\
Work with complex parameters, streaming, performance, and publishing.

You can jump directly to a higher level if you already have experience with node authoring, or follow the full flow from start to finish.

## üìù Tip

Start with something simple and build up.\
The goal is to understand the structure first, then layer on complexity as needed.
