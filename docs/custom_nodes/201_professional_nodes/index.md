# Custom Nodes 201 — Professional Nodes

Here you’ll move from “it works” to “it’s solid.”\
This level focuses on testing, error handling, control flow, and organizing your work.

By the end of 201, you’ll:

- Write and run automated tests for your nodes
- Handle failures gracefully with `SuccessFailureNode`
- Add logging and debugging output
- Understand when to use a library instead of just a sandbox
