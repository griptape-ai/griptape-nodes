# Custom Node Quickstart Overview

This Quickstart walks through the process of building a custom node in Griptape using the sandbox environment.\
The goal is to help you get from an empty folder to a working node without setting up a full node library.

## What you'll do

- Set up a sandbox for building and testing nodes
- Create a minimal node
- Run it inside the sandbox
- Extend it with parameters and logic

This guide is aimed at tech artists and pipeline TDs with Python experience who want to start building quickly.

## Prerequisites

- An existing installation of [Griptape Nodes](https://griptapenodes.com)
- A code editor ([Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Cursor](https://cursor.com/), or similar)
- Basic familiarity with Python

No additional packages or global tools are required.

## Learning path

1. [Setup](setup.md) — Prepare your local sandbox
1. [Hello Node](hello-node.md) — Create your first working node
1. [Node Anatomy](node-anatomy.md) — Understand node structure

## After completing this section

- You'll have a working node running in the sandbox
- You'll understand the basic structure of a node (class, ports, capabilities)
- You'll be ready to move on to [102 Useful Nodes](../102_useful_nodes/index.md) for practical node development

## Next steps

In the next section, you’ll set up a sandbox environment where you can build and run your first node.
