## 🚀 Quick Installation

### Option 1: Griptape Nodes Desktop (Recommended)

Download [Griptape Nodes Desktop](https://www.griptapenodes.com/griptape-nodes-desktop) — a bundled app that includes both the engine and the editor. No additional setup required.

### Option 2: Manual Engine Install

For users who prefer to install the engine directly:

1. **🔐 Login:** Visit [Griptape Nodes](https://app.nodes.griptape.ai/) and log in or sign up using your Griptape Cloud credentials.

1. **💾 Install Engine:** Install the engine using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):

    ```bash
    uv tool install griptape-nodes
    ```

1. **⚙️ Initial Configuration (Automatic on First Run):**

    - The first time you run the engine command (`griptape-nodes` or `gtn`), it will guide you through the initial setup:
    - **📁 Workspace Directory:** You'll be prompted to choose a directory where Griptape Nodes will store configurations, project files, secrets (`.env`), and generated assets. You can accept the default (`<current_directory>/GriptapeNodes`) or specify a custom path.
    - **🔑 Griptape Cloud API Key:** Return to the [Griptape Nodes setup page](https://app.nodes.griptape.ai/) in your browser, click "Generate API Key", copy the key, and paste it when prompted in the terminal.

1. **🚀 Start the Engine:** After configuration, start the engine by running:

    ```bash
    griptape-nodes
    ```

    *(or the shorter alias `gtn`)*

1. **🔗 Connect Workflow Editor:** Refresh the Griptape Nodes Workflow Editor page in your browser. It should now connect to your running engine.

You're now ready to start building flows! 🎉 For more detailed setup options and troubleshooting, see the full [Documentation](https://docs.griptapenodes.com/).
